# RockPaperScissors
A traditional fun game usually played with our hands that we used to play when we were kids. 
How to play traditionally:
Started by a chant of “Rock, Paper, Scissors”), each time raising one hand in a fist and swinging 
it down on the count, opposing players “throw” their selection into the middle. 
Rock is designated by maintaining the fist, Scissors by extending the middle and index fingers, 
and Paper by holding the hand out flat. If players throw out the same gesture, the game goes on. 
If not, it’s decided by a harmonic and intransitive method — rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, but paper covers rock.

How to play in the application:
copy the program and paste it in a python interpreter.
Type rock, paper or scissor as per choice and there you go.
Scores can be viewed at the end.
